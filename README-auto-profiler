The auto-profiler.py tool is used to find desired operating points for each die.

auto-profiler requires pyusb.  To install it:
  pip install --pre pyusb

Put these into a file /etc/udev/rules.d/01-hashfast.rules:

ATTRS{idVendor}=="297c", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev‚Äù, ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="297c", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8001", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2ff6", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"

RUNNING
===========

Start the tool by with:
$ ./auto-profiler.py

Enter the main tool by typing 's' for start.

If you have a disabled die, enter it here. 4 = No die are disabled.

The tool will now run automatically. Please do not touch the keyboard. Press CTRL + C to quit.

The tool will pick a starting frequency. It will then adjust voltage until the error rate is minimized.

Once each die has it's error rate minimized at that frequency, it will step up the frequency.

Above is repeated.

At the end of the test, results are printed in the LOG window. You will now be able to program your board with any combination of these settings.
