This directory contains useful utilities for working with the boards.

Suggested Ubuntu 13.10 packages:
libusb-1.0-0-dev
libusb-1.0-doc

Suggested ArchLinux package:
core/libusbx

Running "make" under Ubuntu 13.10 or ArchLinux should just work if the
above libusb packages are installed.  There have been problems with
older Ubuntus (such as the LTS release) as libusb_strerror() seems not
to be defined on those platforms.

The general theory of these tools: they are used for testing which
means that there should only be one HashFast board connected at a
time.  If there is more than one, these tools with exit with an error.

board_util.c: common routines used by the others.
writeserial.c: writes a serial number of form "HF::<16 hex digits>::FH"
readserial.c: reads serial number from board and prints it out
ping.c: sends a packet over USB to the board which simply sends it back
coremap.c: prints out the map of good and bad cores on the board
  (Note that the EVK1101 board seems to believe it has no cores in emulation.)

These header files are copied from the uc repository and will need to
be updated periodically by hand:
hf_protocol_be.h
hf_protocol.h
hf_factory.h
